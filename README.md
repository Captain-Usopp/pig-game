## How to play

* Player 01 repeatedly rolls a die by clicking on roll dice button until a 1 is rolled out or the player decides to "hold"
* To hold the score player can click on hold button
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
